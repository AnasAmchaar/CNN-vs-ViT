## **📖 Overview**  
This repository contains our research paper, **"A Comprehensive Comparison of Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers in Computer Vision."**  

In this work, we explore the fundamental differences between **CNNs and ViTs**, their strengths, weaknesses, and potential hybrid approaches that merge the best of both architectures.  

## **📌 Key Topics Covered**  
✅ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Evolution, strengths, and applications  
✅ **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: How they work, advantages, and limitations  
✅ **Comparative Analysis**: Performance, computational efficiency, and real-world use cases  
✅ **Hybrid Models**: Combining CNNs and ViTs for optimal results
